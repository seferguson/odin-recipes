<h3>What is acai and why is it so good?</h3>
<p></p>
Acai (aa-sigh-ee) is a type of berry that is primarily found in the Amazon, and is considered a super fruit. 
This is due to its' many <a href="https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/fruit/health-benefits-of-acai-berries.html">health benefits</a>, such as its' potential to improve cardiovascular health as well as regulating blood pressure. 
These benefits specifically apply to unsweetened acai, so be sure to double check the ingrediants before purchasing any acai frozen packs!

<p></p>

One of the tastiest, and most popular, ways of consuming acai is through smoothie bowls with acai as a staple ingrediant. 
When making smoothie bowls, be sure to use frozen fruits so that you can create a thicker consistancy, almost like a sorbet or ice cream (but much healthier).
